Hi, I'm Léo! I'm the creator of Bugscraper. You are seeing this message because 
you obtained this game, in one way or another, without paying for it. 

Don't worry!! I'm not mad, and I won't do anything. Culture shouldn't be 
accessible only to those who can afford it. 

However, games are a labor of love. This game took me almost 3 years to make and 
I poured hundreds of hours of my life into it. Games are very hard to make, so if 
you want to see more games, and better games, please support the people who 
make them. <3

If you can't afford this right now, consider supporting me in other ways! Share the 
word with others! Or you can purchase this game later on, if you end up liking it. :) 

I hope that you have fun playing Bugscraper!

Léo
