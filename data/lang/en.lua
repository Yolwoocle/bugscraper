    * Reference document for all enemies, players, levels, etc:

    * Even though my target audience is people who already play games, since the game supports 
      local co-op and has very simple, accessible controls, it's not absurd to think that more 
      occasional gamers would try their hand at the game, so try to avoid english gamer terms like 
      "kills", "checkpoint", etc, except if it's the normal established term for the word (e.g. "jetpack", etc). 
    * It is very easy for me to add more characters if needed, just tell me and I'll do it.
