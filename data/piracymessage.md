Hey, I'm Léo! I'm the creator of Bugscraper. You are seeing this message because you obtained this game, in one way or another, without paying for it. Don't worry!! I'm not mad, and I won't do anything. Culture shouldn't be accessible only to those who can afford it. 

However, games are a labor of love. This game took me almost 3 years to make, I poured hundreds of hours of my life into it. Games are very, very, hard to make, so if you want to see more games and better games, please support the people who make them, if you can. <3

If you can't afford it right now, consider supporting me in other ways! Share the word with others! Or you can purchase this game later on if you like it. :) 

I hope you have fun playing Bugscraper!

Léo

(If you are seeing this message but DID buy the game, whoops this is a bug! Please notify me on GitHub or by email!!)
