Hey, I'm Léo! I'm the creator of Bugscraper. You are seeing this message because you obtained this game, in one way or another, without paying for it. Don't worry!! I'm not mad, and I won't do anything. Culture shouldn't be accessible only to those who can afford it. I certainly would not be where I am if I couldn't pirate some games as a child. 

However, games are a labor of love. This game took me almost 2 years to make, I poured hundreds of hours of my life into it. If you can't afford it right now, consider supporting me in other ways! Share the word with your friends! Post videos online! Or you can consider purchasing this game later on if you like it. :)

I hope you have fun playing Bugscraper!

Léo
