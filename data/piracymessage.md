Hey, you are seeing this message because you obtained this game, in one way or another, without paying for it. Don't worry, I'm not mad, and I won't do anything. Culture shouldn't be accessible only to those who can afford it. I certainly would not be where I am if I couldn't pirate some games as a child. However, games are a labor of love. This game took me almost 2 years to make, I poured hundreds of hours of my life into it. If you can't afford it right now, consider purchasing it later! Or share the word with your friends, who might buy it!

I hope you have fun playing Bugscraper!
