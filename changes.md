# Bugscraper changelog

### 0.8
(*2025-09-27*)

#### Highlights
- üîä **Sound design** has been completely reworked from scratch, thanks to the work of the new sound designer in the team, Martin Domergue!! Please note that this is still a work in progress, and do not hesitate to send feedback and criticism, it is highly appreciated.
- ü™¥ **New 4th department!** The Gardens are the Bugscraper's highest area, a luxurious place where reside the company's highest ranked executives. Please note that it is still a work in progress and a lot of things are still placeholders.
- üîò **New "interact" button!** This button is used to open up the new cafeteria interface, to exit the game, or to collect guns. Unfortunately this will reset your custom remappings, I'm sorry :(

## 0.7
(*2025-07-01*)

New update!!! Please report any issues you run into!

This is a small update with some of the content that I've been working on. From now on, I will limit the amount of new content I add (apart from the upcoming dept. 4) as I start heading towards the release of the game, hopefully towards the end of August (no guarantees, though). Sorry for the lack of news, I had a lot in my life and didn't want to rush things out. Please be patient, thank you for waiting. :)

I'm sorry to say that this update will reset your progress, I've made it so that it doesn't boot up the whole tutorial animation, but as I said last time I'll work on a more permanent solution in the future.

- **Added**: Wall climbing now uses a stamina system: jumping and sliding uses up stamina, and when you run out of it, you will fall 
- **Added**: Energy Drink upgrade: combo meter decreases more slowly
- **Added**: In co-op, you will now become a ghost after dying. Ghosts can shoot small bursts of bullets that deal a little damage. Players can be respawned from ghosts by breaking cocoons that will appear a few waves later
- **Added**: New sounds from the new sound designer in the team, Verbaudet! More sounds are to come in future updates!
- **Change**: Respawned players will now appear with full health, however cocoons appear more rarely  
- **Change**: Espresso now lasts for 20 floors (prev. 10)
- **Change**: Hot chocolate now affects natural recharging (the recharging that happens after waiting for a few seconds)
- **Change**: Beelets from dept. 2 no longer appear spiky when angered
- **Change**: Reskinned and polished the Stabee enemy, from dept. 2
- **Change**: Background fan in dept. 2 now spins 
- **Change**: Polished up dept. 3 cabin background
- **Change**: Added a cooldown for cloud storm enemy (temporary name)
- **Change**: Improvements in the player animations, in particular, the damage and invincibility animations
- **Fix**: Partial fix to an issue where some enemies like boomshrooms, stink bugs' clouds, and larvae spawned from projectiles, would clip into the ground and teleport. This might still happen, just hopefully to a lesser degree
- **Fix**: Fixed visual bugs related to TV presentation

## 0.6 
(*2025-03-22*)

First Steam beta release (after a year of development, never too late..!) If you had the game before, I'm sorry to say that this release will reset your progress (skins & upgrades). I'll work on a more permanent solution in the future but right now this the best way I found to avoid incompatibility bugs. Be expected for this to happen often in a game still in beta. :P

- **Added**: Option to replay the tutorial in the settings 
- **Added**: You can press down to go through platforms
- **Change**: Various improvements to the tutorial
- **Change**: Improved flying nests (temporary name): now only shoot in defined directions and will flash before exploding after being killed
- **Change**: You now have more upgrades when first starting the game to avoid cases where upgrade jars would spawn empty 
- **Change**: Honeypot footballs (temporary name) explode faster so it doesn't ruin your combo
- **Change**: You can no longer attack dept. 2 bee boss with bullets
- **Change**: Increased opacity for Stink bug poison cloud
- **Change**: Espresso upgrade now lasts for 10 floors instead of 1 minute
- **Fix**: Quick restarting no longer has that small ‚Äúintro‚Äù
- **Fix**: Drill bees (temporary name) now give some fury when exploding
- **Fix**: Ground floor music no longer plays when reviving a player 

## Older versions
I didn't write changelogs for older versions, but you can probably access these versions at [yolwoocle.itch.io/bugscraper](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/bugscraper) and look for the changes yourself.
