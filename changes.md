## 0.6 
(*2025-03-22*)

First Steam beta release (after a year of development, never too late..!) If you had the game before, I'm sorry to say that this release will reset your progress (skins & upgrades). I'll work on a more permanent solution in the future but right now this the best way I found to avoid incompatibility bugs. Be expected for this to happen often in a game still in beta. :P

- **Added**: Option to replay the tutorial in the settings 
- **Added**: You can press down to go through platforms
- **Change**: Various improvements to the tutorial
- **Change**: Improved flying nests (temporary name): now only shoot in defined directions and will flash before exploding after being killed
- **Change**: You now have more upgrades when first starting the game to avoid cases where upgrade jars would spawn empty 
- **Change**: Honeypot footballs (temporary name) explode faster so it doesn't ruin your combo
- **Change**: You can no longer attack dept. 2 bee boss with bullets
- **Change**: Increased opacity for Stink bug poison cloud
- **Change**: Espresso upgrade now lasts for 10 floors instead of 1 minute
- **Fix**: Quick restarting no longer has that small “intro”
- **Fix**: Drill bees (temporary name) now give some fury when exploding
- **Fix**: Ground floor music no longer plays when reviving a player 

## Older versions
I didn't write changelogs for older versions, but you can probably access these versions at [yolwoocle.itch.io/bugscraper](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/bugscraper) and look for the changes yourself.
