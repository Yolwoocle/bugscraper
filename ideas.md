- The classic Centipede where you need to destroy all part of his body to beat him.
- A praying mantis waiting for you to be a certain radius to attack.
- I don't know the english name but how about two "gendarme" sticking together but when one of them dies the other is pissed

- Homing SMG: Tire des ptites boules qui visent l'ennemie le plus proche mais font peu de dégâts.

- Check out Stray Shot. It has some cool enemies in a similar context: https://punkcake.itch.io/stray-shot
- For example spinning a spike ball or moving faster after you damage it

- you could a peashooter type stationary turret , maybe an enemy that creates temporary platforms on death . 
- someone that teleports or swaps between itself and a clone . 
- I reckon there's lots of great ideas in hollow knight of all places too

---

- You can think enemy type (shooter, chaser, tank, etc..) and they're variations: shoots one bullets, many bullets, bullets on death, explode on death, etc..
- You can also think about the player's reaction you want to create: prioritizing certain target, forcing movement, etc

- Snail that spits out spiked slug
