Check out Stray Shot. It has some cool enemies in a similar context: https://punkcake.itch.io/stray-shot

For example spinning a spike ball or moving faster after you damage it

you could a peashooter type stationary turret , maybe an enemy that creates temporary platforms on death . 

someone that teleports or swaps between itself and a clone . 

I reckon there's lots of great ideas in hollow knight of all places too

The classic Centipede where you need to destroy all part of his body to beat him.

A praying mantis waiting for you to be a certain radius to attack.

I don't know the english name but how about two "gendarme" sticking together but when one of them dies the other is pissed

You can think enemy type (shooter, chaser, tank, etc..) and they're variations: shoots one bullets, many bullets, bullets on death, explode on death, etc..

You can also think about the player's reaction you want to create: prioritizing certain target, forcing movement, etc
