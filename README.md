**NOTE:** if you are here to obtain a free version of the game, I'm okay with that, but please consider sharing the game with other people, or [supporting me financially](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/bugscraper) if you can. Thanks 🙂!

Welcome to the bugscraper.
Here, nefarious insects and pests all around the world come to plan their next mischief. 
Stop them before it is too late!

Rise to the top of a bug-infested tower by fighting on an elevator. On each floor, waves of enemies will come for your skin (or rather, exoskeleton). With your trusty pea gun, eliminate them and prepare for the next floor!

## Running & contributing
To run the game, please follow the instructions on the [LÖVE Getting started page](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started).   
To export the game, please look into [Makelove](https://github.com/pfirsich/makelove).   
Please note that I was in highschool when I began this project. I did not always plan for the future or make the best design choices when it comes to code architecture. The code is almost not documented. Modify at your own risk.

## Distribution
Please feel free to reuse, modify, or remix the source code of the game for any non commercial project.   
If it is commercial please [contact me first](https://yolwoocle.github.io/aboutme.html) (I'll probably say yes!).   
I am very lax with what you can do with the source code, but please note that I reserve all rights of the original work (just in case).
