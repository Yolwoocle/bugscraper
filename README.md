## Is this game open source?
**This game is _NOT_ [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)**, rather it is [source available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software). Some of the assets I use are incompatible with a traditional open-source licence. **Not having a licence means that by default I reserve all original rights for the game, even if the code is public.**  

However, this is moreso to legally cover my ass from abusers. I am very lax with what you can do with the source code. Please feel free to reuse, modify, fork or remix it for any non-commercial project. Please do not directly distribute any executables. Please note that I reserve the right to act accordingly if I see any abuse. 

If it does not fit that description please [contact me first](https://yolwoocle.com/about). I don't bite! :)

## Contributing

Please note that I was in highschool when I began this project. I am basically the only maintainer and I did not always plan for the future or make the best code design choices. The code is almost not documented and there are many, many, many things I would do differently if I were to start from scratch. You have been warned. 

For any questions you can [contact me](https://yolwoocle.com/about), by email (`leo@yolwoocle.com`) or on Discord (`@yolwoocle`) preferably.
