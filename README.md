Welcome to the bugscraper.
Here, pests all around the world come to gather.
Your mission: stopping them before it is too late!

Rise to the top of a bug-infested tower by fighting on an elevator. On each floor, waves of enemies will come for your skin (or rather, exoskeleton). With your trusty pea gun, eliminate them and prepare for the next floor!

To run the game, please follow the instructions on the [LÖVE Getting started page](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started).   
To export the game, please look into [Makelove](https://github.com/pfirsich/makelove).   

Please note that I was in highschool when I began this project. I am basically the only maintainer and I did not always plan for the future or make the best code design choices. The code is almost not documented. You have been warned. For any questions you can [contact me](https://yolwoocle.com/about) (on Discord preferably).

<!-- ## Can I pirate your game?
I don't care. I'm not here to tell you what you should do. I'm making this game for my own enjoyment and I don't financially depend on it.

This isn't about me, but you: by choosing to buy or pirate a game, you are judging whether you are financially capable of affording it and supporting the developer. Not everyone is comfortable financially. But also, making games is a difficult task. People pour their soul and heart into providing enjoyment to others, usually with very little gains. It is often a labor of love. When you buy a game, you are also expressing your gratitude towards that work. 

So, you decide. 🙂  -->
