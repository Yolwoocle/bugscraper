**NOTE:** if you are just here to obtain a free copy of the game, fair enough, but please consider sharing the game with other people, or [supporting me financially](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/bugscraper) if you can. Thanks! 🙂

Welcome to the bugscraper.
Here, pests all around the world come to gather.
Your mission: stopping them before it is too late!

Rise to the top of a bug-infested tower by fighting on an elevator. On each floor, waves of enemies will come for your skin (or rather, exoskeleton). With your trusty pea gun, eliminate them and prepare for the next floor!

## Is there a licence?
<u>This game is **NOT** <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open source</a></u>, rather it is [source available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software). Some of the assets I use are incompatible with a traditional open-source licence. **Not having a licence means that by default I reserve all original rights for the game.**  

However, I am very lax with what you can do with the source code. Please feel free to reuse, modify, or remix the source code of the game for any non commercial project, as long as you're not directly distributing the code, files, or any executables.

If it does not fit that description please [contact me first](https://yolwoocle.com/about) (I'll probably say yes!).

## Contributing

Please note that I was in highschool when I began this project. I am basically the only maintainer and I did not always plan for the future or make the best code design choices. The code is almost not documented. You have been warned. 

For any questions you can [contact me](https://yolwoocle.com/about) (on Discord preferably).

<!-- ## Can I pirate your game?
I don't care. I'm not here to tell you what you should do. I'm making this game for my own enjoyment and I don't financially depend on it.

This isn't about me, but you: by choosing to buy or pirate a game, you are judging whether you are financially capable of affording it and supporting the developer. Not everyone is comfortable financially. But also, making games is a difficult task. People pour their soul and heart into providing enjoyment to others, usually with very little gains. It is often a labor of love. When you buy a game, you are also expressing your gratitude towards that work. 

So, you decide. 🙂  -->
